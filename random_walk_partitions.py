'''This script is meant to perform random walk partitioning from a boundary
Authors: Bryce McLaughlin and Amara Jaeger
The general idea is that we begin at the boundary of a state (represented by a super node)
and perform a random walk until we reintersect our path, which may be on the boundary.
At the point of reintersection we create a cycle, which will be used to partition the graph
into multiple parts.
Implementation (for k=2):
-Augment Shapefile to include an outerface/district which touches all boundary districts
-Create [Adjacency Matrix for] dual graph (later: weighted probability of edges to adjust probability distribution)
-Create a random walk of districts and assign them all to partition group 2
-Randomly selected a node which is not one of these and use a BFS to create partition 1 around this district
-Assign all other districts to partition 2 (this guarantees that we will have two connected partitions)

###Required Libraries

import networkx as nx #for graph datatypes and such
import geopandas as gpd #for shapfile reading
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for general visualizations
import random #for random choices
import queue as q #for BFS searching
import copy

###Temp Stuff

#Temporary graph for testing
G = nx.grid_graph(dim = [10,10])
G.add_node("boundary")
for i in range(0,10):
    for j in range(0,10):
        if i == 0 or j == 0:
            G.add_edge('boundary', (i,j))
        if i == 9 or j == 9:
            G.add_edge('boundary', (i,j))

'''
Current State of Random Walk: We ran histograms on 10 by 10 grid graphs with different step counts. 
It appears that requiring a walk of length 45 or 50 in this case produced the most even results. 
We were not able to get a spike around equal partitioning while only requiring minimum walk length. 
The major issues for low walk counts in that they would return to the boundary too quickly and therefore there 
would be a very large partition 1 in most cases and small partition 2. 
Large values had the opposite problem in which the walk would create many small areas and the random sampling 
would often create very small partition 1s. Upon talking to Justin it appears like a good next step 
would be to look at making the random walk respond to some sort of global potential we update on every iteration. 
Lorenzo suggested using a Brownian Bridge model to implement this.
